# Think Words â€“ The Fast-Paced, Family-Friendly Word Game

Think Words is a quick-thinking word game that challenges players to react quickly. At the start of each round, players enter a category. The timer starts, and the first player must think of a word that fits the category.

You have to think of a word within the set timer duration. Once you have a word, press the corresponding letter key and say the word. The timer resets automatically. Then it's the next player's turn, who must find a new word using one of the remaining letters.
